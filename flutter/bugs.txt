If you run flutter doctor and see a message saying "[!] Android Studio (not installed)", don't worry. You can fix this by pointing Flutter to the location of your Android Studio installation.

Here's what to do:

Open your terminal.

Type the following command: flutter config --android-studio-dir="C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio"

This path is the typical location for Android Studio. However, if you installed Android Studio in a different location, simply replace "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio" in the command with the path to where your Android Studio is installed. Make sure to include the path within the quotes. This will help Flutter recognize where Android Studio is located on your computer.
