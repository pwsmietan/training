ML Notes
-----------------------------------------

- Data Pre-Processing
	- import the data
	- clean the data
	- split into training and test sets
		- dependant variable: predict sales price of cars
		- independant var: mileage, age of cars
		- separate data before processing
		- use linear regression
		- model is applied to data
		- compare predicted values to actuals
		
	
- Modelling
	- Build the model
	- Train the model
	- Make predictions
	
- Evaluation
	- Calculate performance metrics
	- Make a verdict
	
- Feature Scaling
	- applied to columns (not rows)
	- normalization: subtract minimum [0;1]
	- standardization: subtract average [-3;+3]
